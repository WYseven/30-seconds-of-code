In event-driven applications, there is usually a main loop that listens for events and trigger callback functions accordingly when one of these events is detected.</p></div></div><div class="card code-card"><div class="section card-content"><h4 id="event-loop.md">Event loop</h4><p>The event loop handles all asynchronous callbacks. Callbacks are queued in a loop, while other code runs, and will run one by one when the response for each one has been received.
